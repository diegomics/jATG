This analysis estimates historical population sizes from a single genome sequence using the Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent (PSMC). Considering its limitations (e.g., assumptions about recombination rates and low accuracy for recent historical changes), it's a powerful way to glean insights about the demographic history of the species directly from the assembly.

### How to run?

Requirements:
* [Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com)
* [Conda](https://docs.conda.io)


1) Edit `1.stats_variables.cnf` file with the respective paths, values and parameters.

2) Install needed software with: `bash 2.install_stats_dependencies.sh`

3) Run the masking pipeline in _Slurm_ with: `bash 3.Run_stats.sh`

\*) It uses up to 8 cpus and 16 Gb of RAM
