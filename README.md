# Just Analyze This Genome
🧬 ➡️ 🙏 ➡️ 🤖 ➡️ 📊 ➡️ 🥹 

Workflow (nextflow?) to run a bunch of analyses on a genome to start understanding where we are and where we can go.

A. preliminary analysis
* Stats
* Masking

B. annotation independent analysis
* Genome-wide heterozygosity
* Runs of homozygosity

* GC content and CpG islands ### this should be moved to A. (like pre-masking) <--------------??

* Historical population size inference
* Generation time and mutation rate inference

* Conserved synteny
* Structural variants

C. annotation dependent analysis
* BUSCO genes
* Orthologs sets
*
*
