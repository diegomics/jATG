# Just Analyze This Genome
🧬 ➡️ 🙏 ➡️ 🤖 ➡️ 📊 ➡️ 🥹 

Workflow (nextflow?) to run a bunch of analysis on a genome in order to start to understand where we are and where we can go

* A) preliminary analysis (masking & stats)
* B) annotation independent analysis
Genome-wide heterozygosity
Runs of homozygosity

GC content and CpG islands

Historical population size inference
Generation time and mutation rate inference

Conserved synteny
Structural variants
* C) annotation dependent analysis
