# The user must specify the length and number of the discrete time intervals on which the population size is constant, by adjusting the -p and -t options.
# Both parameters should be manually chosen such that after 20 rounds of iterations, at least ~10 recombinations are inferred to occur in the intervals each parameter spans.
# A poor choice of intervals can lead to over- or underfitting of the model.
